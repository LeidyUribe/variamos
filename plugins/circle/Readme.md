# CircleModel
This is an example about how to define a plugin in VariaMos.
This model only contains a CircleElement (with a circle figure) that can be placed in the model area.

# Installation
- Copy and paste the circle plugin folder here: src/assets/js/custom_models/. 
- Run VariaMos, open VariaMos in the browser, and go to the config section. Click the button "Discover installed models".
- Now the circle model should appear in the list.
- Go to the projects section, and create a new project with the CircleModel.
- Verify that the model allows you to create circles.
- Congratulations, plugin installed.

# Uninstall
- Remove the src/assets/js/custom_models/circle/ folder and that's it.
